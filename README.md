You can copy index and css files to your computor and from there you can edit and add your schedual and updates to the index page.
you can then create a repository on git and use gh-pages to put your page on the web .... then give me the link address 
to your page and ill attach it to the main page. or fork this one.(you can tell i dont have much practice using git hub yet)

or handier download to your computor edit and add your sdhedual and updates and in command prompt use surget to upload the web page
give me your surge link and ill add that to the main page 
this link will walk you through it http://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge

if you have node.js installed on your computor all you have to do is open command prompt
npm install --global surge 

then cd to your folder and then .....  surge --domain redpandajohnl3.surge.sh // change johnl3 to your username
as the first help section he adds name during the process eg surge picked name gave option to change ... when i did it 
i didnt get a option to change name so after looking at next section saw this way and its better

next when you have page up do the CNAME follow instructions you can do it from command prompt very easily
then when you edit files in future all you do is cd to folder and surge ./ 

third choise dont use template create a simple one yourself host it with gh-pages or surge give me link to add to main
if you go this route keep it simple
